## Short description:

AI-based tool which makes your online shop display products tailored to each customer’s individual needs, expectations and interests.

## Definition

Product recommendation engine covers personalised recommendation frames, which, based on AI algorithms, display to each customer products tailored to their individual needs, expectations and interests.


## How does it work?

The solution uses advanced technology, i.e. artificial intelligence algorithms, thanks to which the system records the behavioural data of each user, follows their interaction paths and predicts their further actions, creating a separate purchasing profile. Therefore, every customer is presented in real time with product suggestions that perfectly match their interests, current needs and expectations.

Thanks to our app you can:
 - reduce bounce rate and unsuccessful purchasing decisions taken by
   your clients
 - optimise your product offer and your clients’ shopping experience
 - increase user involvement and interest in shopping in your e-shop
 - boost your conversion rate and sales volume

The most popular recommendation frames are:
-   Recommended for you: each user will receive a "Recommended for you" product offer tailored to their current needs and based on their interaction path on the shop's website, i.e. the history of viewed and searched products during the last/last few sessions;
-   Cross-selling: each user will receive product recommendations that complement the one they are watching during the current session;
-   Similar products: recommendation frame will display to the user products that are most often displayed by other users, together with the products currently viewed;
-   Previously viewed: recommendation frame will display to the user products they previously viewed during the current session;
-   Abandoned cart: recommendation frame will display to the user products that were added to their cart last time but were not purchased
